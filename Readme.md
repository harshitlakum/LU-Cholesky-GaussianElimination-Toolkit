# LU-Cholesky-GaussianElimination-Toolkit

A collection of clear and efficient implementations of core matrix factorization algorithms—LU decomposition (with and without pivoting), Gaussian elimination, and Cholesky decomposition—in both Python and MATLAB.

## Structure

- `python/` — Python implementations
- `matlab/` — MATLAB implementations

## Algorithms Included

- Back substitution for upper triangular systems
- LU factorization with partial pivoting (PA = LU)
- In-place LU factorization (no pivoting) using outer product formulation
- Cholesky decomposition with positive definiteness check

## Usage

### Python

1. Navigate to the `python/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd python
